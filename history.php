			<h2>Remembering the Publisher</h2>
			<b>Gabriel Murrel Cohen, founder, editor,  publisher of the weekly newspaper</b>
			"His basic desire was to help people find the truth in their own way. He did
			not preach to people, but gave them a sense of adventure of the incredible 
			diversity of ideas around which people engage. Rather not publishing opinions
			of which he strongly disagreed, he would include them but write an editorial
			explaining his opposing view." <a href="pdf/tribute.php">read more</a> of the original pdf

		<p> <span class="redblock">HISTORY</span> Gabriel M. Cohen (1908-2007) began publishing a Kentucky edition of the newspaper 
		 in 1930 and founded the Indiana edition 5 years later. The National Jewish Post & Opinion premiered in 1948, and the Missouri 
		 edition ran from 1948 through 1992. At one time, there were two other editions - one for Chicago and one for New York. Subscribers 
		 to the national edition come from all over the United States, Canada, and Israel, with a few international subscribers. Many 
		 well-known writers got their start with the newspaper, including Carl Alpert, Moshe Kohn, Yossi Klein Halevy and Daniella Ashkenazy.
